# cs383-sp22-swaprect

This is an example from CS 383 from the Spring 2020 semester to swap rectangles in an image using the GD image functions as asked by a student in class.

Please note that for the sake of getting through the example during the scheduled class time, some "shortcuts" are taken that should be completed when building an app intended for production, as described in the lecture.
